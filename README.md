# JointMErecon \
Example code to run joint multi-echo reconstruction on a set of phantom data \
The phantom data was acquired using 3-echo rEPI with R=2. Under-sampling factor for each echo is 6. Echo time difference is 1.52ms between two consecutive echoes.

# Executiong \
To run this example, download all files to a local folder, then run the script Joint_meRecon.m using MATLAB \
The code has been tested using MATLAB 2022a. It should be compatible with a recent version of matlab (i.e., after R2019).
